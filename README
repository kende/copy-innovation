== Copy Innovation

## Gist:

Old copy + patent reform arguments are stale. What we need are copy + patent innovation.


## Vision: 

1. Inform tech savvy + general public, engaged voters + elected officials about the dangers of E-Parasites / Protect IP.
2. Respond with voice + money. 
3. Defeat these bills.
4. Envision what a copy + patent framework that is truly dedicated to enhancing innovation would look like.
5. Tell that story.

## Ideas:

Collect the best videos, websites, arguments, and efforts towards copy + patent innovation in one place.

Launch a ChallengePost campaign for the best videos produced explaining while ProtectIP/E-Parasites are so bad. Include hooks for appeals to speak up, write Congress, share, and crowdfund opposition to these bills + support for better ones.
